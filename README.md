# Master Vanquisher Reforged

Master Vanquisher Reforged is a modernized version of the original GWA2 **MASTER VANQUISHER** project, updated and expanded for **GWAu3**. The project is designed to automate Guild Wars vanquishing across all campaigns while maintaining compatibility with modern systems.
